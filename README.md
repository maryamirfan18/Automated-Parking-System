Automated-Parking-System.<br />
<br />
An automated parking system code which would allow the user to store data of every car which has entered or left the parking lot. The code would allow the user to check which slot in the parking lot is free and can accomodate a car. The car number plate, driver name and age would be stored against that slot to improve security and have an elaborated detail of the cars in the parking lot. When a car exits the parking lot the driver would be charged accordingly and once the car leaves the parking slot against that car would be again set to free until another car takes it's place.

# SCOPE
The code will cover:<br />
• Which car slot is free and which one is occupied.<br />
•Improve security as not only the number plate of the car would be stored but the driver name and age would also be considered.<br />
•Real time availibilty of the parking slots would be displayed.<br />
•Charges of parking would be calculated according to the rate fixed per hour by the code itself.<br />
•Time for which the car was parked would be noted and then the charges would be calculated.<br />
•When a car exits the slot would automatically be free to accomodate another vehicle# Automated-Parking-System<br />
